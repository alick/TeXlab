This is the git repo of my TeX lab. Here are some templates and scripts which may be useful for others.

I run tests to make sure these documents can compile fine using TeX Live latest. Other TeX distros should also work. See [TUG][tug] for information about installation of various TeX distros.

中文文档依赖 ctex 宏包，并且需要使用 XeLaTeX 引擎进行编译。
